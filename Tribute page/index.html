        <p><b>In this text I will introduce</b> some of the most renowned solo albums from <b><u>Haruomi Hosono</u></b>.
          He has been one of people I respect most, not only for the music he creates, but also for the music that he
          introduces as well as his intriguing personality. <b>Below are my top 5</b> favorite solo albums from him.
          Many might know Hosono from YMO (the project which he himself brought to life) or Happy End, but only solo
          albums will be mentioned in this article. </p>

          <span><b>Hosono House</b> (1973)</br></br>
            Besides Hosono, this album also features performances by the group "Caramel Mama" (featuring Hosono's fellow
            Happy End member Shigeru Suzuki). Hosono wanted to emulate The Band's Music from Big Pink and James Taylor's
            One Man Dog. With this album, recording equipment technology had evolved enough for domestic recordings of
            good quality to be feasible, and going to the center of the city to reach a recording studio was somewhat
            inconvenient. The album was recorded for five hours every afternoon in a 144 square foot large bedroom in
            Hosono's residence in Sayama, Japan (with a 16-track mixing console in his living room). The instruments
            were recorded unprocessed from the amplifiers in a small room, leading to the album's unique sound. Hosono
            continued to develop the tropical style of Hosono House in his following works, Tropical Dandy and Bon
            Voyage co..

            Tropical Dandy is Haruomi Hosono's second solo album. This album continues the tropical style of Hosono

            part of a box set with bonus tracks taken from Tin Pan Alley albums by Crown decades later.

            Bon Voyage co. (泰安洋行, Taian Yōkō) is Haruomi Hosono's third solo album. This album continues the tropical
            style of Hosono House and Tropical Dandy (which would continue later on with Paraiso) while showing
            influence from the music of New Orleans and also features performances from Tin Pan Alley and Happy End
            (excluding Takashi Matsumoto). The album's Japanese title was influenced by a Nagasaki convenience store of
            the same name that Hosono met while on Tin Pan Alley's "First & Last Concert Tour". This album was re-issued
            as part of a box set with the single version of the Tropical Dandy song "Peking Duck" (which was coupled
            with a song from this album) and an interview Hosono gave on a Tokyo Broadcasting System radio show.

            Shigeru Suzuki and future YMO members Ryuichi Sakamoto (who would later perform an altered version of

          <span><b>Philharmony</b> (1982)<br></br>
            Following Yellow Magic Orchestra's first wave of success, Hosono took a break from the group and, with help
            from Alfa Records head Kunihiko Murai, established Yen Records in 1982. The label's inaugural release was
            Philharmony, a masterwork recorded almost entirely by Hosono himself at his brand new LDK Studio. With
            unlimited studio time and freedom to explore, Hosono let himself loose with an array of synthesizers and the
            latest gadgets, from the Prophet 5 to the E-mu Emulator - all listed as "guest performers" in the album
            credits. Inspired by the possibilities opened up by these music-making tools, Hosono found new ways to
            approach his songwriting, resulting in a set of songs that showcase his ability to constantly and
            consistently innovate and create new standards. With ambient synthscapes like "Luminescent/Hotaru" and the
            abstract sample-based expressionism of "Birthday Party" sitting perfectly in tune alongside pop favorites
            like "Sports Men" and "L.D.K.", Philharmony is one of the most well-loved of Hosono's albums, and a favorite
            of the artist himself.
